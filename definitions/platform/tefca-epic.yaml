  This platform type is used for TEFCA Facilitated FHIR -- Epic. 
  It should have all the same parameters as the Epic platform type, but with the addition of `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` and a different Client ID. 
  By default, no Endpoints will be associated with this Endpoint, however this PlatformType can be set using the Facilitated FHIR Client. 
  
  As we support additional TEFCA specific facilitated FHIR platforms, we will need to add them as custom platforms.
